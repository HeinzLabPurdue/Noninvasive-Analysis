1. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) analysis for artifact removal, threshold estimation, and peak/trough picking.
2. Envelope frequency response (EFR) analysis for RAM and AM/FM stimuli
3. Otoacoustic emission analysis for distortion product (DP), stimulus frequency (SF), and transient evoked (TE) based on forward pressure level (FPL) calibration
4. Wideband middle ear muscle reflex (WBMEMR) analysis
